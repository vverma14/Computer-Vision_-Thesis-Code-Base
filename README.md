# Segmentation and Classification
This is the code base of my thesis, titled "Segmentation and Classification of Melanoma". Melanoma is a deadly form of skin cancer and there is a need of early diagnosis to increase the chances of survival in patients. 
Computer Vision has proved to be a key tool in the field of image processing. It has achieved accuracies which can sometimes surpass humans. There is always a need of an automated tool(Aritficial Intelligence) to help doctors and this field of engineering does exactly that. The aim of this thesis was to integrate segmentation into classification to increase the classification accuracy. This was succesfully done and I defended my thesis on April, 9th 2021.
