# Thesis-Code-Base
This is the code base of my thesis, titled "Segmentation and Classification of Melanoma". Melanoma is a deadly form of skin cancer and there is a need of early diagnosis to increase the chances of survival in patients. 
Computer Vision has proved to be a key tool in the field of image processing. It has achieved accuracies which can sometimes surpass humans. There is always a need of a tool to help doctors and this field of engineering does exactly that. The aim of this thesis was to integrate segmentation into classification to increase the classification accuracy. I was able to achieve that and the final classification results are 87% balanced accuracy. You can find more in the power point presentation slides uploaded.
